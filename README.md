# JaProject1

This Java program extends the JFrame class and implements the ActionListener interface to make a word counter, where one types into a textbox whatever they choose and,
when the button is clicked, it displays how many words and characters were typed, including spaces. There are also buttons allowing one to set the color of the textbox 
and text. This project is simple and minimalistic, but this is the first time in Java where I worked with buttons, colors, and textboxes, so please do not dismiss this.
